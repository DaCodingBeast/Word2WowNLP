Arman, the elder, had a knack for algorithms, weaving complex neural networks with a quiet precision, while Kian, the dreamer, painted their AI app's vision with bold strokes of innovation.

"I just trained the model on Rumiâ€™s poetry," Arman said, his voice steady but laced with pride. "Imagine an AI that not only predicts what you want to write but inspires you to feel," Kian replied, his eyes alight with excitement.

They poured their heritage into the app, embedding the wisdom of ancient Persian poetry into its soul, aiming to create an AI that could understand and craft verses with human-like grace. As the call to prayer echoed from a distant minaret, they exchanged a glance, silently vowing to bring their creation to life and bridge the old with the new.""")

Ava, barely looking up from her work, smiled and said, "It's fine, Bolt. You can't improve without a few messes." As she returned to her creation, Bolt quietly started cleaning up, hopeful that his next mistake would be a better one.""")
